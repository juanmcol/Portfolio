# Personal Portfolio

## Project Details
First Commit!  

This is my first real project using git and github.  

This will become (hopefully) a personal portfolio. For the moment, it's mostly barebones. All I did was add a fancy "The" to the website's body. There's a preview in the assets folder, which I'll include in the README file.  

I jumped ahead to step 4, in the Project Tasks file, in order to get a better feel for git + github and see how the project develops over time. At the moment, I don't have all the best practices. For example, should I even have a Project Tasks file in a specs folder :) ? Seems better to have it in there as a sort of "roadmap" for this project. It'll probably look even nicer next to a spec sheet or a wireframe. Oh well... If it's wrong, you live and you learn.
