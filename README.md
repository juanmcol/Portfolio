## Project Details
### 6th Commit! 

Made the website more mobile-friendly.

### Previous Commit

Added a responsive design and a click to expand feature for the table. Also made it so that if one resizes the window manually (e.g. on a desktop), then the table goes back to its original placement.

Still some details that could be improved. Especially, on mobile. The font size may be too small right now. I'd have to see it on my phone or something to test it out.

Image used is from Hackers (1995).
