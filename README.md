## Project Details
2nd Commit!  

Made a wireframe for the website and dropped it in the specs folder. Probably a bit more detail than necessary, but I wanted to mess around with Figma and learn how to use it. Pretty neat.  

## Wireframe
The overall design is subject to change. I definitely want a featured section. "And this is where I'd put my best project. If I had one!"
